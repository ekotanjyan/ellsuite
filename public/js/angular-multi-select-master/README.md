Angular MultiSelect
==
An AngularJS directive which creates a dropdown button with multiple or single selections. 
Allows you to customize your labels and use some HTML tags in the data. Fully configurable through element attributes and CSS.
Doesn't require jQuery and works well with other Javascript libraries.

Note

<br />ATTENTION: new version is coming (in about 1 or 2 weeks) so at the moment I won't be merging pull requests. Instead I will manually add them into the version I am working on.
<br /><br />I'm open to new ideas but will prioritize those which can serve greater good.
<br /><br />Kindly let me know if you use this directive in your projects -just open a new issue in Github- or star the directive if you like it. It's a huge motivation for me. Thanks!
